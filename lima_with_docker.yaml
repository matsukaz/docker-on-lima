  # Load ~/.ssh/*.pub in addition to $LIMA_HOME/_config/user.pub .

# FURTHER ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================== #

firmware:
  # Use legacy BIOS instead of UEFI.
  # Default: false
  legacyBIOS: false

video:
  # QEMU display, e.g., "none", "cocoa", "sdl".
  # As of QEMU v5.2, enabling this is known to have negative impact
  # on performance on macOS hosts: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/334
  # Default: "none"
  display: "none"

network:
  # The instance can get routable IP addresses from the vmnet framework using
  # https://github.com/lima-vm/vde_vmnet. Both vde_switch and vde_vmnet
  # daemons must be running before the instance is started. The interface type
  # (host, shared, or bridged) is configured in vde_vmnet and not lima.
  vde:
    # vnl (virtual network locator) points to the vde_switch socket directory,
    # optionally with vde:// prefix
    # - vnl: "vde:///var/run/vde.ctl"
    #   # VDE Switch port number (not TCP/UDP port number). Set to 65535 for PTP mode.
    #   # Default: 0
    #   switchPort: 0
    #   # MAC address of the instance; lima will pick one based on the instance name,
    #   # so DHCP assigned ip addresses should remain constant over instance restarts.
    #   macAddress: ""
    #   # Interface name, defaults to "vde0", "vde1", etc.
    #   name: ""

# Port forwarding rules. Forwarding between ports 22 and ssh.localPort cannot be overridden.
# Rules are checked sequentially until the first one matches.
portForwards:
  - guestPort: 61123
    hostIP: "127.0.0.1" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"; allows privileged port forwarding
#   # default: hostPort: 443 (same as guestPort)
#   # default: guestIP: "127.0.0.1" (also matches bind addresses "0.0.0.0", "::", and "::1")
#   # default: proto: "tcp" (only valid value right now)
#   - guestPortRange: [4000, 4999]
#     hostIP:  "0.0.0.0" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#   # default: hostPortRange: [4000, 4999] (must specify same number of ports as guestPortRange)
#   - guestPort: 80
#     hostPort: 8080 # overrides the default value 80
#   - guestIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#     hostIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#   # default: guestPortRange: [1024, 65535]
#   # default: hostPortRange: [1024, 65535]
#   - guestPort: 8888
#     ignore: true (don't forward this port)
#   # Lima internally appends this fallback rule at the end:
#   - guestIP: "127.0.0.1"
#     guestPortRange: [1024, 65535]
#     hostIP: "127.0.0.1"
#     hostPortRange: [1024, 65535]
#   # Any port still not matched by a rule will not be forwarded (ignored)
